# Twitter Data Wrangling
Data wrangling project based on Twitter data

#### by Sooyeon Won 


### Keywords 
- Gathering data from different sources: Flat file, URL, API 
- Handling Data Quality and Tidiness Issues 

### Summary of Findings 

This project is mainly focuses on how I, as a data analyst, get the proper data. In this analysis, I collected datasets from Udacity URL, directly-downloaded flatfiles and also using Tweeter API. In the second part, I made a small report to answer the following questions based on the obtained datasets. 

  - The popularity of each dog "stage" (i.e. doggo, floofer, pupper, and puppo)
  - The method of accessing to twitter
  - The number of counts for retweet and favorite to get insight into popularity of tweets
  - Relationship between retweet_count and favorite_count
  - The proportion of image predictions that predict dog images as the first stage
